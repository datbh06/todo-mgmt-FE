# Todo Management Application

This is a web-based to-do management application built using Spring Boot and React. The application provides secure REST APIs using Spring Security and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Features

- **Server-side**: The server-side of the application is built using Spring Boot and provides secure REST APIs using Spring Security.
- **Register and Login**: The application provides REST APIs for user registration and login. These APIs are secured using JWT.
- **Client-side**: The client-side of the application is built using React and implements the register and login features.
- **Decentralization**: The application has been decentralized into normal users and admin users. Normal users can register for an account, log in, and mark to-do tasks as complete or pending. Admin users have all the permissions of normal users, as well as the ability to add, update, and delete tasks.

## Usage

To use the application, simply register for an account as a normal user or log in as an admin user. Once logged in, you can manage your to-do tasks by marking them as complete or pending. If you are an admin user, you can also add, update, and delete tasks.
